Developer installation on mac osx (updated on 15th of july ,2013)
=================================

This file is supposed to guide you step by step to have working (compiling) version of Powiter on mac osx ( >= 10.6 ). 
You need an up to date macports version. Just download it and install it from : 
(Macports website)[http://www.macports.org]

##Note

If you're planning on writing a CMAKE based project file, and that you succeed in making it portable(windows/linux/osx), please send a mail at immarespond at gmail dot com.

##Install libraries

In order to have Powiter compiling, first you need to install the required libraries.

###Qt 4.8.5

You'll need to install Qt libraries from [Qt download](http://qt-project.org/downloads). Alternatively you can get it from macports:

	sudo port install qt4-mac


###OpenEXR 

This one is not on macports yet. You have two solutions, either you can get the binaries I compiled for osx 64bit on dropbox, or you can download it from :
(OpenEXR on github)[https://github.com/openexr/openexr] and compile it yourself.

Here's the dropbox link for 64bit binaries :(Dropbox link)[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ru7cjns0fjvn7aa/U8iRn3xQEn]

###freetype2

You can either use macports:
	sudo port install freetype
or compile it by yourself from (Freetype download)[http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/freetype/] (make sure to download freetype 2.x)

###ftgl

Again with macports:
	sudo port install ftgl
Or download it and compile it yourself from (FTGL download)[http://sourceforge.net/projects/ftgl/]

###boost

You can download boost from 
(boost download)[http://www.boost.org/users/download/]
or through macports
	sudo port install boost

For now only boost serialisation is required.

We're done here for libraries.

### OpenFX

Go under Powiter_Core and type
	git submodule update -i

###Expat

With macports:

	sudo port install expat	


###Add the config.pri file

You have to define the locations of the required libraries. This is done by creating a .pri file that will tell the .pro where to find those libraries. The only library to put in the config.pri file on unix systems is boost. For all other libraries are found with PKGConfig.

- create the config.pri file next to the Powiter.pro file.

You can fill it with the following proposed code to point to the libraries. Of course you need to provide valid paths that are valid on your system.

INCLUDEPATH is the path to the include files

LIBS is the path to the libs


boost {
    INCLUDEPATH += /opt/local/include
    LIBS += -L/opt/local/lib -lboost_serialization-mt
}

###Build with Makefile
You can generate a makefile by typing
 cd <YOUR_PATH_TO_POWITER>/Powiter && qmake Powiter.pro

then type
	make
This will create all binaries in the build_Powiter folder.

###(Optional) Build on QtCreator

Open Powiter.pro and under the tab Projects,locate the Build Environment section. You need to add to your path /opt/local/bin so pkg-config launched by  QMake can find the libraries. This is not necessary when using QMake from the command line because /opt/local/bin is already in the path.

###(Optional) Build on Xcode:

You can generate an Xcode project by typing the following command where Powiter.pro is located:

qmake -spec macx-xcode Powiter.pro

You'll need to edit the file /etc/launchd.conf and add this line

setenv PATH /opt/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin

And restart your computer so it takes it into account.
