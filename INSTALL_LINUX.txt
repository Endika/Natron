developer installation for linux
==================================

This file is supposed to guide you step by step to have working (compiling) version of Powiter on linux. 

##Note
If you're planning on writing a CMAKE based project file, and that you succeed in making it portable(windows/linux/osx), please send a mail at immarespond at gmail dot com.

##Install libraries

In order to have Powiter compiling, first you need to install the required libraries.

###Qt 5

You'll need to install Qt (5.0.2 as of writing) libraries from [Qt download](http://qt-project.org/downloads). 

###FFMPEG

You'll need to get ffmpegfrom the packet manager : 
	sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

###OpenEXR 2.0.0

You have two solutions, either you can get the binaries I compiled for linux on dropbox, or you can download it from :
(OpenEXR on github)[https://github.com/openexr/openexr] and compile it yourself. 

Here's the dropbox link for 32bit binaries :(Dropbox link)[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/a42hus72e39wf3g/WkRPPcR1TS]

(64bit) will come soon.

###freetype2

You can get it from the packet manager:
	sudo apt-get install freetype2


###ftgl

Again, you can get it from apt-get:
	sudo apt-get install ftgl


###boost

Boost headers are required, but not the libraries. You can download boost from 
(boost download)[http://www.boost.org/users/download/]
Alternatively you can install boost from apt-get:
	sudo apt-get install libboost1.50-all-dev

### Eigen

You can download Eigen from macports :
	sudo apt-get install eigen


We're done here for libraries.


###Add the config.pri file

You have to define the locations of the required libraries. This is done by creating a .pri file that will tell the .pro where to find those libraries.

- create the config.pri file next to the Powiter.pro file.

You can fill it with the following proposed code to point to the libraries. Of course you need to provide valid paths that are valid on your system.

INCLUDEPATH is the path to the include files

LIBS is the path to the libs

openexr2{
    INCLUDEPATH += /home/developpeur/Downloads/OpenEXR_2.0.0_linux64/include/OpenEXR
    LIBS += -L/home/developpeur/Downloads/OpenEXR_2.0.0_linux64/lib -lIlmImf -lIex -lImath -lHalf -lIlmThread
}

ftgl{
    INCLUDEPATH += /usr/include
    LIBS += -L/usr/lib -lftgl
}
ffmpeg{
    INCLUDEPATH += /usr/include
    LIBS += -L/usr/lib  -lavcodec -lavformat -lavutil -lswscale -lavdevice -lavfilter
}

freetype{
    INCLUDEPATH += /usr/include/freetype2
    LIBS += -L/usr/lib -lfreetype
}

freetype2{
    INCLUDEPATH += /usr/include
}

boost{
    INCLUDEPATH += /usr/include
}

qtincludes{
    INCLUDEPATH += /home/developpeur/Qt5.0.2/5.0.2/gcc_64/include
}
eigen{
    INCLUDEPATH += /usr/include
}


###(Optional) Build :

You can generate a makefile by typing the following command where Powiter.pro is located:

qmake Powiter.pro

build by typing 

make
