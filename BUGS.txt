Here is a list of know bugs, ordered by priority from high to low:

- before calling Instance::renderAction(), the host should call
Instance::isIdentityAction(). If it returns kOfxStatOk, then the host
should copy the result from the named input clip. See doc.
http://openfx.sourceforge.net/Documentation/1.3/ofxProgrammingReference.html#kOfxImageEffectActionIsIdentity
For example, the OFX Custom Parameter Example (from Examples) has no
render action, but isIdentity always returns OK

- a plugin that returns an error during the "load" or "describe" actions,
  for example if it requires a missing suite
  (e.g. ParametricParameterSuite for OFX/Color/RGBLut), should *not*
  appear in the menus.

- When viewing a single component (R, G, or B), is should be displayed
  as grayscale, because blue has a very low luminance. Another
  solution would be a channel-specific display, where for example for
  the blue channel the values 0-0.0722 would be mapped linearly to
  (0,0,0)-(0,0,255), and the values 0.0722-1.0 would be mapped
  linearly to (0,0,255)-(255,255,255). This gives the same luminance
  as the grayscale version, but with a blue clor. 

- The color picker displays the wrong information when viewing a
single component (all other components are 0, except alpha which is 1)

- On OSX dragging the viewer pane will freeze the GUI (Qt5 only)

Here is a list of non-blocking bugs / wanted features:

- when time is changed, there are lost of calls to
  kOfxActionBeginInstanceChanged/kOfxActionEndInstanceChanged (one for
  each Knob), which should be concatenated intojust  one.
