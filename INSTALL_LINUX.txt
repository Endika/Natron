developer installation for linux
==================================

This file is supposed to guide you step by step to have working (compiling) version of Powiter on linux. 

##Note
If you're planning on writing a CMAKE based project file, and that you succeed in making it portable(windows/linux/osx), please send a mail at immarespond at gmail dot com.

##Install libraries

In order to have Powiter compiling, first you need to install the required libraries.

###Qt 4.8.5

You'll need to install Qt libraries from [Qt download](http://qt-project.org/downloads). Alternatively you can get it from apt-get.


###OpenEXR

Download OpenEXR from http://www.openexr.com/downloads.html and install it.
2.0 features are not supported for now and a pre 2.0 version is enough to make it work.


###boost

You can download boost from 
(boost download)[http://www.boost.org/users/download/]
Alternatively you can install boost from apt-get:
	sudo apt-get install libboost1.50-all-dev

For now just boost serialisation is required.

### OpenFX

Go under Powiter and type
	git submodule update -i

###Expat

	sudo apt-get install expat

###GLEW

	sudo apt-get install libglew-dev

We're done here for libraries.



###Add the config.pri file

You have to define the locations of the required libraries. This is done by creating a .pri file that will tell the .pro where to find those libraries. The only library to put in the config.pri file on unix systems is boost. For all other libraries are found with PKGConfig.


- create the config.pri file next to the Powiter.pro file.

You can fill it with the following proposed code to point to the libraries. Of course you need to provide valid paths that are valid on your system.

INCLUDEPATH is the path to the include files

LIBS is the path to the libs


boost{
    INCLUDEPATH += /usr/include
    LIBS +=  LIBS += -L/usr/lib/ -lboost_serialization-mt
}


### Build:

The <srcPath> must be absolute and <buildPath> must not be a subdir of <srcPath>


mkdir <buildPath>
cd <buildfolder>
qmake <srcPath>/Powiter.pro
make

If you want to build in DEBUG mode change the qmake call to this line:

qmake CONFIG+=debug <srcPath>/Powiter.pro
