Check out http://mrkepzie.github.io/Powiter_Core/ for a full presentation on what is Powiter and the concepts.
Development for the Core of the software is not yet opened and SDK API is not released yet.

A more complete documentation will come as the development progress.

NB: The name of the project isn't final yet and will be determined in the next week or two. (july 14th as of writing).
A full licensing scheme should come along. In the following weeks you can expect a new website to come aswell as a
new,revamped, graphical user interface. The goal is to have a version of the software supporting OpenFX for November
2013. Stay tuned for a lot of changes.
