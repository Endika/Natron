Here is a list of the know bugs:


- On OSX dragging the viewer pane will freeze the GUI (Qt5 only)

- Entering a directory with the file dialog that has image sequences inside will cause the history to bug.

- Selecting a sequence of files that is not contiguous will result in a crash. This is not a bug, rather this is an unsupported feature.
