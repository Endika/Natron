Here is a list of the know bugs:

- Crash when opening a file dialog on linux too early

- Black frame when pausing/resuming an un-cached sequence

- On OSX dragging the viewer pane will freeze the GUI

- Selecting a sequence of files that is not contiguous will result in a crash. This is not a bug, rather this is an unsupported feature.
