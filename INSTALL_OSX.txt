Developer installation on mac osx (updated on 15th of july ,2013)
=================================

This file is supposed to guide you step by step to have working (compiling) version of Powiter on mac osx ( >= 10.6 ). 
You need an up to date macports version. Just download it and install it from : 
(Macports website)[http://www.macports.org]

##Note

If you're planning on writing a CMAKE based project file, and that you succeed in making it portable(windows/linux/osx), please send a mail at immarespond at gmail dot com.

##Install libraries

In order to have Powiter compiling, first you need to install the required libraries.

###Qt 5

You'll need to install Qt (5.0.2 as of writing) libraries from [Qt download](http://qt-project.org/downloads).Once downloaded, remember the path where you install it as we will need it into Xcode.

###FFMPEG

Open a terminal and type:
	sudo port install ffmpeg
It should install it to your macports download tree. By default it should be something along the lines of /opt/local 

###OpenEXR 2.0.0

This one is not on macports yet. You have two solutions, either you can get the binaries I compiled for osx 64bit on dropbox, or you can download it from :
(OpenEXR on github)[https://github.com/openexr/openexr] and compile it yourself.

Here's the dropbox link for 64bit binaries :(Dropbox link)[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ru7cjns0fjvn7aa/U8iRn3xQEn]

###freetype2

You can either use macports:
	sudo port install freetype
or compile it by yourself from (Freetype download)[http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/freetype/] (make sure to download freetype 2.x)

###ftgl

Again with macports:
	sudo port install ftgl
Or download it and compile it yourself from (FTGL download)[http://sourceforge.net/projects/ftgl/]

###boost

Boost headers are required, but not the libraries. You can download boost from 
(boost download)[http://www.boost.org/users/download/]
or through macports, but it will also install the boost libraries:
	sudo port install boost


### Eigen

You can download Eigen from macports :
	sudo port install eigen

We're done here for libraries.

### OpenFX

go under Powiter_Core and type
	git submodule update -i


###Add the config.pri file

You have to define the locations of the required libraries. This is done by creating a .pri file that will tell the .pro where to find those libraries.

- create the config.pri file next to the Powiter.pro file.

You can fill it with the following proposed code to point to the libraries. Of course you need to provide valid paths that are valid on your system.

INCLUDEPATH is the path to the include files

LIBS is the path to the libs

openexr2{
    INCLUDEPATH += /usr/local/include/OpenEXR
    LIBS += -L/usr/local/lib -lIlmimf -lIex -lImath -lHalf -lIlmThread
}

ftgl{
    INCLUDEPATH += /usr/local/include
    LIBS += -L/usr/local/lib -lftgl
}
ffmpeg{
    INCLUDEPATH += /opt/local/include
    LIBS += -L/opt/local/lib  -lavcodec -lavformat -lavutil -lswscale -lavdevice -lavfilter
}

freetype{
    INCLUDEPATH += /opt/local/include/freetype2
    LIBS += -L/opt/local/lib -lfreetype
}

freetype2{
    INCLUDEPATH += /opt/local/include
}

boost{
    INCLUDEPATH += /opt/local/include
    LIBS += -L/opt/local/lib -lboost_system-mt -lboost_thread-mt -lboost_filesystem-mt -lboost_serialization-mt -lboost_python-mt -lboost_log-mt
    LIBS += -L/opt/local/lib -lboost_program_options-mt
}

qt{
    INCLUDEPATH += /Users/Lex/Qt5.1.0/5.1.0/clang_64/include
    QMAKE_LFLAGS += -F/Users/Lex/Qt5.1.0/5.1.0/clang_64/lib
    LIBS += -framework QtCore -framework QtGui -framework QtConcurrent -framework QtOpenGL -framework QtWidgets
}

opengl{
    QMAKE_LFLAGS += -F/System/Library/Frameworks
    LIBS += -framework OpenGL
}

eigen{
    INCLUDEPATH += /usr/local/include
}


###(Optional) Build on Xcode:

You can generate an Xcode project by typing the following command where Powiter.pro is located:

qmake -spec macx-xcode Powiter.pro
