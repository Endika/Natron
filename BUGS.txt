** Here is a list of know bugs, ordered by priority from high to low:

- Tab traversal is completely broken. This is a major GUI bug.
  Many users still have a keyboard and use it, so this must be fixed.
  Refs:
  http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qwidget.html#setTabOrder
  http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/focus.html
  
- resizing the Viewer fits the frame to the viewer height. It should
  do it only if the frame was already fitted. Use cas: zoom into the
  image, resize the viewer => you lose your zoom settings.

- In the Dot Generator plugin, the interact cannot be moved in Natron

- The Interact from the "OFX Custom Parameter Example" does not appear in Natron in some cases (reported by Fred)

** Here is a list of non-blocking bugs / wanted features:

- derive and integrate are not implemented for animated Double,
  Double2D, Double3D, RGBA, RGB parameters (derive returns 0,
  integrate returns (t2-t1)*getValue())

- The OFX keyframe interface is missing some functions unimplemented yet:
OfxParameterSuiteV1::paramEditBegin — Used to group any parameter changes for undo/redo purposes
OfxParameterSuiteV1::paramEditEnd — Used to group any parameter changes for undo/redo purposes

OfxParameterSuiteV1::paramCopy — Copies one parameter to another, including any animation etc...

- support Parameter Interacts, which are integrated in the parameters panel
http://openfx.sourceforge.net/Documentation/1.3/ofxProgrammingReference.html#ParametersInteracts

- support absolute/normalized double parameters:
http://openfx.sourceforge.net/Documentation/1.3/ofxProgrammingReference.html#ParameterPropertiesDoubleTypes

- implement Fields and Field Rendering:
  http://openfx.sourceforge.net/Documentation/1.3/ofxProgrammingReference.html#ImageEffectsFieldRendering

- implement framerate support
  (look for various instances of "temporal coordinates", "framerate" and "frame rate" in the documentation)

- support more image components:
  kOfxImageComponentAlpha
   "uk.co.thefoundry.OfxImageComponentMotionVectors" (forward motion?  backward motion? both?)
   "uk.co.thefoundry.OfxImageComponentStereoDisparity"(left-to-right? right-to-left? both?)

- On OSX dragging the viewer pane will freeze the GUI (Qt5 only)

- On Ubuntu 13.10 with Qt5, Natron is non-functional (transparent widgets, extra windows...)
