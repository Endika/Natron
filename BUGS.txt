** Here is a list of know bugs, ordered by priority from high to low:

- a plugin that returns an error during the "load" or "describe" actions,
  for example if it requires a missing suite
  (e.g. ParametricParameterSuite for OFX/Color/RGBLut), should *not*
  appear in the menus.

- When viewing a single component (R, G, or B), is should be displayed
  as grayscale, because blue has a very low luminance. Another
  solution would be a channel-specific display, where for example for
  the blue channel the values 0-0.0722 would be mapped linearly to
  (0,0,0)-(0,0,255), and the values 0.0722-1.0 would be mapped
  linearly to (0,0,255)-(255,255,255). This gives the same luminance
  as the grayscale version, but with a blue clor. 

- The color picker displays the wrong information when viewing a
single component (all other components are 0, except alpha which is 1)

- On OSX dragging the viewer pane will freeze the GUI (Qt5 only)

** Here is a list of non-blocking bugs / wanted features:


- String animation is not yet supported. An animated string can only
  have "constant" interpolation, and could be represented in the curve
  editor with the keyframe number as "y".

- Custom animation, which depends on String animation, is not
  supported. Custom animation can either have "constant" or "custom"
  animation (if the plugin provides the
  kOfxParamPropCustomInterpCallbackV1 property). "custom" animation
  could be represented as linear interpolation in the curve editor.

- The OFX keyframe interface is not implemented yet (and it should not
be difficult to implement):
OfxParameterSuiteV1::paramGetNumKeys — Returns the number of keyframes in the parameter
OfxParameterSuiteV1::paramGetKeyTime — Returns the time of the nth key
OfxParameterSuiteV1::paramGetKeyIndex — Finds the index of a keyframe at/before/after a specified time.
OfxParameterSuiteV1::paramDeleteKey — Deletes a keyframe if one exists at the given time.
OfxParameterSuiteV1::paramDeleteAllKeys — Deletes all keyframes from a parameter.
