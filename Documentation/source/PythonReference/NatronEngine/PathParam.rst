Detailed Description
--------------------

By default the user can select a single directory as path, unless 
:func:`setAsMultiPathTable()<NatronEngine.PathParam.setAsMultiPathTable>` is called in which
case a table is presented to the user to specify multiple directories like this:

.. figure:: multiPathParam.png
	:width: 400px
	:align: center
	
When using multiple paths, internally they are separated by a *;* and the following characters
are escaped as per the XML specification:

	* *<* becomes &lt;
	* *>* becomes &gt;
	* *&* becomes &amp;
	* *"* becomes &quot;
	* *'* becomes &apos;
	
Some more characters are escaped, you can see the full function in the source code of Natron
`here <https://github.com/MrKepzie/Natron/blob/workshop/Engine/ProjectPrivate.cpp>`_
